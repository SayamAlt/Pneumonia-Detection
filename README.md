## Content

The dataset consists of 3 subdirectories, namely train, val and test with each of them containing chest X-Ray images of two classes of interest i.e. Normal and Pneumonia. 

The train set has about 4877 images, with 3707 images of Pneumonia and 1176 images of Normal Chest X-Ray Image. 
The val set has around 349 image files, with Normal constituting about 173 files and Pneumonia composed of 176 images.
The test set consists of 624 images, with 234 Normal images and 390 Pneumonia images.
